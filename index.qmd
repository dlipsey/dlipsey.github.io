## Hi

I'm a PhD Candidate in Health Services and Policy Research (Health Economics Track) at Boston University. 

I study process changes made by health care delivery systems and payers to figure out what works and what doesn't. I'm interested in insurance benefit design, low-value care, and health information technology. My time is split between supporting Veterans Health Administration operations (quality improvement, program evaluation) and my dissertation, which measures the effects of implementing a provider-facing, performance-based, tiered specialist network.
